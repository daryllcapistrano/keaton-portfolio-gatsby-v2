Few things for the website:

<!-- 1. I started a vimeo page and was hoping to swap out all the youtube videos on my website for the vimeo versions - https://vimeo.com/user135455357 -->

<!-- 2. There are two new videos to add: SID and SLEEPY -->

<!-- 3. I wetransfered you ALL NEW thumbnails (all 16x9) -->

<!-- 4. Remove Bitters and demo reel videos from site -->

<!-- 5. Layout- I think we should swap it to two columns and also minimal descriptions below the videos kind of like the music video page on this site: http://adamnewportberra.com/music-video AND for mobile version I figure they can just stack on top of eachother one by one -->

<!-- 6. Order of videos:

Vans - The Skate Authentic
Maple XO - Farewell 2020
Worn Path
Prana - Maifest Farm
SID
Slime Balls - Social Promos
Bronson Bearings
This is a Zine - Black Lives Matter

<!-- 7. Add Vans and Thrasher to Client page (also, client page is a little funky on phone) -->
